## Introduction

This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for disease prediction and personalized health recommendations. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system can analyze symptoms and predict the most likely disease. Additionally, it offers tailored recommendations for precautions, medications, diets, and workouts based on the predicted disease.

## Features

* Predicts diseases based on user-inputted symptoms.
* Provides personalized health recommendations for the predicted disease.
* Includes precautions, medications, diets, and workout suggestions.
* User-friendly interface.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of diseases, symptoms, and associated health recommendations. The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and used to train the machine learning model.

## Model

A Random Forest Classifier model is employed for disease prediction. The model is trained on the dataset and optimized for accuracy and performance.

## Recommendation System

The recommendation system utilizes a rule-based approach to provide tailored health recommendations based on the predicted disease. It accesses a database of precautions, medications, diets, and workouts associated with each disease.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to launch the application.
4. Input the patient's symptoms.
5. View the predicted disease and personalized health recommendations.
